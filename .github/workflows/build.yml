            Robust enough to call it a true "Alpha", v1.0.0 of PySN comes jam-packed with new features such as:
            
              - A download progress bar

            Also, the Windows build comes in a cool .zip folder now so that you don't need to make a new folder to keep things organized. Windows has also recently started flagging this as a Trojan, so that's a neat new "feature" I guess.
